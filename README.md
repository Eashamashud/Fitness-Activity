The My Fitness Tracker Application was built using a RESTful API, React.js and bootstrap for the Frontend, 
Java Spring Boot for the backend, and my mySQL as the database. This application allows users to log and track their workouts by recording details such as the exercise name, date, duration, calories burned, and additional notes.

Additionally, users can view and edit previously logged workouts, ensuring they can update their records as needed.
Feel free to check out the application here :)
