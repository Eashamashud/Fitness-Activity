The My Fitness Tracker Application was built using a RESTful API, React.js and bootstrap for the Frontend, 
Java Spring Boot for the backend, and my mySQL as the database. The application allows you to log your workouts, where you can note down your Exercise Name, the date, the duration of the workout, your calories burned, and any additional notes. On top of that, if needed to edit any previous workouts, the user can go back and check all of their previous workouts logged and update it if needed.

Feel free to check out the application here :)
